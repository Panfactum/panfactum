# Account Provisioning

## AAD Access
Access to most of our systems is controlled through your Microsoft AAD account.

You will need a member of `rbac_superusers` to provision you a new user.

They will send you your AAD username and a temporary password.

Login via the [AAD portal](https://portal.azure.com) to finish your account setup.

## Github Organization Access

You will need to be invited to the [Panfactum GitHub Organization](https://github.com/Panfactum).

Send a member of `rbac_superusers` your GitHub username and they will send the invite. You will
need to check the email address associated with that GitHub user and accept the invite before
the organization will be visible in the Web UI.

## Access to other systems

It may take a few hours for your user permissions to propagate from AAD to our other service providers.
If you need access sooner, please have a member of `rbac_superusers` complete the
[manual service provider steps](/company/engineering/guides/access-control/new-user-setup).
