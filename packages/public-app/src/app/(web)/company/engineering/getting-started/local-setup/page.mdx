## Installation

This section covers the required tooling that you will need to have installed.
Use the following table as a reference, but please ensure that you:

- Execute the installations in the order presented

- Check the installation notes for each utility below the table; they contain **<u>required</u>** steps

| Tool     | Purpose                                                                    | Installation Docs                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `nix`    | Package management tool used to install many binary dependencies           | [Docs](https://nixos.org/download.html)                |
| `podman` | Container/Pod management utility                                           | [Docs](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) |
| `devenv` | Sets up your host-level dev environment                                    | [Docs](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/)             |
| `direnv` | Automatically load the dev environment when entering the project directory | [Docs](https://devenv.sh/automatic-shell-activation/)  |

### Installation Notes

`podman`

- Once you do the default `podman` install, you will need to follow [this guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md) for enabling rootless podman.
  This enables you to run `podman` as a non-root user (e.g., without `sudo`) as well as utilize user-specific podman settings.

- Ensure that you are storing the configuration files in the proper directory under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (usually `~/.config/containers`). They should not be under `/etc` or `/usr`.

- Ensure that you are not using the VFS storage driver which has issues in rootless mode (see the [docs](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md#ensure-fuse-overlayfs-is-installed))

- You will need to provide some extra configuration to your `/etc/containers/container.conf`. Merge the values in our <a target="\_blank" className="markdown" href={"/downloads/files/containers.conf"}>provided template</a> in order to:
    - increase the `pids_limit` as some of our local containers run more processes than allowed by the system default
    - increase the `ulimits` for number of files allowed to be opened as building images often requires opening many files at once

- To prevent resource exhaustion, please make the following `sysctl` changes (see [docs](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/sysctl) for persisting changes across restarts; distribution-dependent)
    - `fs.inotify.max_user_instances` set to `1280`.
    - `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` set to `655360`.
    - `kernel.dmesg_restrict` set to `0`

#### `devenv`

- Do **not** install `cachix`; it is not needed.

## Downloading the Monorepo

1. Clone the [panfactum monorepo](https://github.com/Panfactum/panfactum) to your local machine. You can do this by running the command `git clone git@github.com:Panfactum/panfactum.git`.

2. `cd` into the cloned directory.

3. You may now see an error message that looks like the following:

   ```
   direnv: error /home/jack/repos/panfactum/.envrc is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its content
   ```

   Run `direnv allow`.

4. At this point, the `devenv` environment setup script should immediately run. It will look similar to the below:

   ```text
   direnv: loading ~/repos/panfactum/panfactum/.envrc
   Building shell ...
   direnv: export +AWS_CONFIG_FILE +AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE +C_INCLUDE_PATH +DEVENV_DOTFILE +DEVENV_PROFILE +DEVENV_ROOT +DEVENV_STATE +DOCKER_HOST +DOCKER_SOCK +IN_NIX_SHELL +KUBECONFIG +KUBE_CONFIG_PATH +LIBRARY_PATH +PKG_CONFIG_PATH +TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD +name ~LD_LIBRARY_PATH ~PATH ~XDG_CONFIG_DIRS ~XDG_DATA_DIRS
   ```

   This may take several minutes to complete as the remaining local development dependencies are installed.

5. If everything completes successfully, you should have the following environment variables set (check via `printenv | grep DEVENV`):

   ```text
   DEVENV_DOTFILE=/home/jack/repos/panfactum/panfactum/.devenv
   DEVENV_ROOT=/home/jack/repos/panfactum/panfactum
   DEVENV_PROFILE=/nix/store/x9rx3384qckjrrp7668w89bds52xi6vs-devenv-profile
   DEVENV_STATE=/home/jack/repos/panfactum/panfactum/.devenv/state
   ```

   **Your values will be specific to your machine and the above is just an example.**

## Setting up User Variables

At the root of the repo, you will need to create a `devenv.local.nix` file that will contain your user-specific settings.

Here is an example:

```nix
{ pkgs, myproject, config, ... }:
{
  # Add your environment variable key pairs in here
  env = {
    LOCAL_DEV_NAMESPACE = "jack";
    CI = "false";
    GITHUB_TOKEN = "XXXXXX";
    VAULT_ADDR = "https://vault.dev.panfactum.com";
  };
}
```

Replace the `env` values with your values based on the table below:

| Value                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `LOCAL_DEV_NAMESPACE` | A short name code that should be unique to you. Used for spinning up personal development stacks in our development cluster.                                                                               |
| `CI`                  | Should be set to `"false"` unless you are attempting to emulate / test the CI system.                                                                                                                      |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`        | Your GitHub [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens). Secret used for interacting with the GitHub API. |
| `VAULT_ADDR`          | The vault instance to connect to for authentication to our systems. For local development, you will want to use `"https://vault.dev.panfactum.com"`.                                                       |

## Editor Setup (Optional)

An (incomplete) guide to working through some editor quirks

### Jetbrains IDEs

1. Select language and package manager binaries from `.devenv/profile/bin` directory manually as they will not be automatically found for you. This includes:
    1. Node.js
    2. NPM
    3. Terraform
