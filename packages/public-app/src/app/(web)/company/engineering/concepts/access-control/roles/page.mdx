# Roles

We utilize Role-based Access Control (RBAC) to control permissions inside our various internal systems.

Roles are assigned via "role groups" in AAD. A role group is any AAD security group prefixed with `rbac_`.

All permissions in the ecosystem should be derived from assignment to these roles (outside of services that require
non-SSO root accounts for system provisioning).

Currently, we have the following roles:

| Role      | Description |
| :---        |:----   |
| `rbac_superusers`      | Root access to all systems       |
| `rbac_engineering_admins`   | Has read and write access to all engineering systems        |
| `rbac_engineers`   | Has read access to all engineering systems. Has write access to the development environment.        |
