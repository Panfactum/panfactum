# Identity Provider

<MarkdownAlert severity={'info'}>We do not use any other Azure or Microsoft products; however, in the future we may want to put status monitoring utilities in an AAD
    subscription.</MarkdownAlert>

We use [Azure Active Directory](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id)
(now Microsoft Entra ID) as our root identity provider.

AAD was chosen for its wide support of identity protocols for the low per-user price point.

## User Management

Users are configured manually in AAD:

<UsersImage/>

Every user must meet the following configuration parameters:

- First and Last Name must be set
- Email must be either `[firstName]@panfactum.com` or `[firstName]_[lastName]@panfactum.com`

See the following guides for user activities:

- [Adding new users](/company/engineering/guides/access-control/new-user-setup)

## Service Provider Integrations

All of our downstream service providers connect to AAD via SSO. Where possible, this is configured via Terraform.
However, there are some SSO integrations that had to be setup manually due to limitations with the AAD Terraform
provider. We call out some of the manual configurations below.

### Google Cloud

The Google Cloud SSO is handled by the "G Suite Connector by Microsoft" and is setup according to the
official guide [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/saas-apps/google-apps-tutorial).

However, due to limitations with that app, we utilize "Google Cloud Directory Sync" provided by Google
for user and group provisioning and de-provisioning. The setup instructions are provided [here](https://apps.google.com/supportwidget/articlehome?hl=en&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.google.com%2Fa%2Fanswer%2F10616183%3Fhl%3Den&assistant_id=generic-unu&product_context=10616183&product_name=UnuFlow&trigger_context=a).

We have some notable settings:

- Users are synced based on their membership in the `gsuite_users` group. Membership should be automatically
  granted after an RBAC role assignment.

- All **Microsoft 365** groups are synced to Google and provided group email addresses. AAD security groups are ignored.

- All users and emails have their internal AAD email domain (`@Panfactum.onmicrosoft.com`) replaced with the Panfactum email
  domain (`@panfactum.com`) as Google is the primary email hosting provider.

### AWS

The AWS SSO via SAML and SCIM is handled via the "AWS IAM Identity Center" AAD enterprise application.
This is setup according to this [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/saas-apps/aws-single-sign-on-tutorial).

The only users and groups that are provisioned in AWS are those that are assigned to one of the role groups who have
access to AWS. Those role groups can be found here:
