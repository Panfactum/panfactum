# Product

**TODO: This needs to be updated**

## Product Development Pipeline

Our work follows the following process:

1. Potential Features are added to the [feature tracker](https://www.notion.so/afc5096eddf3405a93f3042b711a76f2). 
This can happen in a number of ways including following a brainstorming session, a sudden idea, or a follow up from a customer interview. 
**The feature tracker is our source of truth for acceptance criteria.** @Josh Levy is responsible for making sure changes to an active
features AC are reflected in the project tickets.
2. We have a weekly Grooming meeting to decide what features weâ€™d like to implement. The features will then be collaboratively groomed and
ticket in [Linear](https://linear.app/panfactum/team/PAN/projects/active), our workflow management tool. Tickets go into projects which
define the Gantt Chart of our product road map.
3. Work is pointed on 5 points being the equivalent of a single days worth of effort and we assign/reassign 
weekly workloads based on the current workload and velocity of our team.

### Go To Market / Sales

We have a weekly Go-To-Market meeting. This meeting is used to review leads and feature requests from leads as well as assess pricing strategy based
on any new leads/information gained. All leads can be seen on the [Contacts](https://www.notion.so/84570071bf544d9d95cf55fbcb7b5dcf) page including their status and last 
known meeting with one of us. Meetings are tracked on the [Product Interviews](https://www.notion.so/f0c78c3eda0745c9a5eb1f9f82e6d8ad) page which feeds data into 
the Contacts page including number of meetings and date of last meeting.

## Scrum

### Stand Up

We have a daily stand up at 9:00AM EST. The first 15 minutes of this time are for free form discussion of the previous days events
including any blockers discovered and any updates from work streams.

#### Break Outs

All internal, non-regularly scheduled meetings will have an associated [Break Outs](https://www.notion.so/793daaecdcfb468bb3cb82d6af59909c) 
page describing why the meeting was held, notes from the meeting, decisions made, and subsequent action items from the meeting. 
These could be anything from incident postmortems to break outs about 
a specific feature but should always be document so we can return to the decisions made and make sure action items are followed up on.
