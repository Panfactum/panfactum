# Overview

**We believe that a focus on engineering excellence leads to positive outcomes.**

As a result, we make excellence in software engineering our <u>highest</u> priority and aspiration.

Our approach to software engineering sits on three pillars:

1. **Product Design**:  How we ensure our outcomes match our expectations

2. **Application Development**: How we maximize the value of everything that we build

3. **Software Operations**: How we minimize operational costs

## The Pillars

### Product Design

Product Design is everything that makes it possible to * effectively decide* the right things to build.

This pillar's conceptual goal is to <u>minimize</u> the following:

$$
|\frac{outcome}{expectations} - 1|
$$

In other words, we aim to keep the difference between our expectations and the actual outcomes as small as possible.

We break this goal into four focus areas:

1. **Modeling**: How well do we delineate our expectations and model the anticipated outcomes

2. **Measurement**: How well do we measure actual outcomes

3. **Alignment**: How well do we align our stakeholders with the key goals and expectations

4. **Adaptability**: How quickly do we shift expectations to new or changing data

### Application Development

Application development (AppDev) is everything that makes it possible to *efficiently build* software.

This pillar's conceptual goal is to <u>maximize</u> the following:

$$
\frac{\sum(\Delta \$_{revenue} - \Delta \$_{maintenance})}{\$_{build}}
$$

In other words, we endeavor to build software in such a way that maximizes
the total lifetime incremental revenue, minimize the total lifetime incremental maintenance burden, and
minimizes the point-in-time cost to build.

We break this pillar into five focus areas:

1. **Consistency**: How similar are different components in quality, style, and design

2. **Clarity**: Ease of understanding the software system and system components

3. **Complexity**: Ease of integrating changes into the software ecosystem

4. **Resiliency**: How easily do unexpected inputs break the system or system components

5. **Performance**: Does our system meet or exceed customer performance expectations

### Software Operations

Software operations (SoftOps) is everything that makes it possible to *efficiently run* software.

This pillar's conceptual goal is to <u>minimize</u> the following recurring costs:

$$
\$_{problems} + \$_{hosting} + \$_{security} + \$_{toil}
$$

$\$_{bugs}$ is a measure of time spent fixing unexpected problems such as software bugs or infrastructure outages.
$\$_{hosting}$ is a measure of infrastructure costs and managed service costs.
$\$_{security}$ is a measure of time spent securing the ecosystem along with the costs incurred from security lapses.
$\$_{toil}$ is software development time lost to things that could have been automated.


We break this pillar into five focus areas:

1. **Runtime Platform:** Building and managing a secure, resilient, cost-effective platform for all of your software

2. **Development Platform:** Providing tools and frameworks that improve developer velocity and confidence

3. **Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CICD):** Automation for eliminating toil, minimizing bugs, and improving release cadence

4. **Observability:** Surfacing information from your system and ensuring you and your teams know about it first

5. **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Eliminating friction in access control while maintaining zero-trust security and auditor compliance

Each of these areas plays a critical role in our ability to rapidly ship software that is secure, reliable,
performant, cost-effective, and maintainable.
